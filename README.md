# sample-databases: open sample databases for testing and instructional purposes

Having had to build sample databases for testing and instructional purposes,
it's well past time for a place for them to live as I re-grow the collection.

Free to use for any purpose.

## TODO

1. Build small CLI app to load into database of choice
2. Port existing sql to MySQL and others
3. Sample queries
